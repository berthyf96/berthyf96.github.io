Hey there! I'm a first-year PhD student at Caltech in Computing & Mathematical Sciences. Previously, I studied computer science at Princeton University. I'm interested in computer vision, machine learning, and audio synthesis.

This website is meant to host news, publications, and random tidbits as I document my journey through graduate school.
